# 8/31/2021 Wolf Global DeFi Network Research

*DISCLAIMER: I decided to open source some of my research. I love to research and explore new protocols, DeFi primitives, etc. This is just some notes on what i'm checking out. This is not investment advice and all that. If you found my notes helpful consider a donation to one of my [Gitcoin Grants](https://gitcoin.co/grants/2032/colorado-os) or directly to wolfdefi.eth. If you'd like to chat about a project you're working on you can contact me at one of the links here https://wolfdefi.com/*

## EDEN Network
Friend pointed me to EDEN last month, sadly i'm just getting around to checking it out (it's up 200% in last two weeks as of this writing). Really interesting solution for handing the MEV issues on Ethereum.

[EDEN Docs](https://docs.edennetwork.io/)

> Eden Network is a priority transaction network that protects Ethereum traders from malicious MEV and arbitrary reordering. In technical terms, Eden Network is an optional, non-consensus breaking ordering protocol. The protocol creates a transparent and fair set of rules to order transactions within each block.
